# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I absolutely loved the group project. Working on a fun creative project with others is something I didn't even know I missed. It was also very helpful to work together to apply the knowledge we all learned during the course.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
Pretty much everything to do with Bootstrap was a surprise. I'm so glad it exists
- What are you struggling with?
Overall layout, structure of HTML as well as semantic tags. 
- What would you count as a victory?
Feeling more capable in general about designing and styling webpages. It's a great feeling since I was pretty discouraged after struggling with the cool site challenge.
